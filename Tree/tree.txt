a tree is hierachical data structure that consists of node connected by edges
node store the data,where a tree is non linear data structure
compared to array, linked lists stacks and queues which are linear data structure

in linear data structure , the time required to search is proportional to size of 
data set

Tree however owing tp the nonlinear nature allow quicker and easier access to the data

tree uses:
File System 
and organization tree 
DOM
Chat bots

tree Terminology:

 parent and child node---

 BST(Binary search Tree)

 The value of each left node must be smaller than the parent node
 the value of each right node must be greater than the parentnode

            {10}

    {5}              {15}

{3}        {7}       

opertaion :
Insertion To add a nod to the tree
search:to find the node given its value
DFS and BFS: To visit all node in the tree
Deletion : To remove a node given its value
