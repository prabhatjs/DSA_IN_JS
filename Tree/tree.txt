a tree is hierachical data structure that consists of node connected by edges
node store the data,where a tree is non linear data structure
compared to array, linked lists stacks and queues which are linear data structure

in linear data structure , the time required to search is proportional to size of 
data set

Tree however owing tp the nonlinear nature allow quicker and easier access to the data

tree uses:
File System 
and organization tree 
DOM
Chat bots

tree Terminology:

 parent and child node---

 BST(Binary search Tree)

 The value of each left node must be smaller than the parent node
 the value of each right node must be greater than the parentnode

            {10}-----------parent node

{5}              {15}--------------child node 

{3}        {7}  ---child     

opertaion :
Insertion To add a nod to the tree
search:to find the node given its value
DFS and BFS: To visit all node in the tree
Deletion : To remove a node given its value

E,F,C And d Are leaf node
(B,C,D ) and E ,F are sibling
A is an ancestor of E
path (A,E) is A-B-E
Distance (A,E) is 2

degree total number o child node is- Degree(B) is 2
degree of tree is 3 lavel of tree
depth of the node is number of edges form root node
depth of E is 2
root node depth is zero
height of tree is 2 
 

                            (a)--root


            (B)             (C)               (D)
