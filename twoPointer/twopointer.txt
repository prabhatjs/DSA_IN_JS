What is two pointer approch 
It's the use of two different pointers (usually to keep track of array or string indices) to solve a problem involving said indices with the benefit of saving time and space. 

two pointer work like this-

1. Running from both ends of an array
2. Slow & Fast Pointers
Next type is using two pointers with different speed of movement. Typically they starts from the left end,
then the first pointer advances fast and give some feedback to the slow pointer and do some calculation.
3.Running from beginning of 2 arrays / Merging 2 arrays
In this category, you will be given 2 arrays or lists, then have to process them with individual pointers.
4.Split & Merge of an array / Divide & Conquer
